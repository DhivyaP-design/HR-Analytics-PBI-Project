# HR-Analytics-PBI-Report
**Problem Statement:**

The HR department is facing challenges in understanding employee attrition patterns across various departments and demographic segments. To address this, the company needs a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard that provides insights into key metrics such as attrition rate, employee demographics, and job roles.

The goal is to identify trends and factors contributing to employee turnover, such as age, education, salary, and tenure. By analyzing these metrics, the company aims to develop strategies to reduce attrition, improve employee satisfaction, and optimize workforce management.

**Data Gathering and Import**
The initial phase involves collecting the relevant data and understanding the business requirements. For this project, we utilize sample HR data provided in Excel format. After installing Power BI Desktop, we import the Excel data by selecting the correct file type and loading the necessary tables, establishing a connected dataset in Power BI.

**Data Transformation**
Once the raw data is imported, the next step is to clean and transform it to prepare for analysis. Key steps include:

**Removing Irrelevant Columns:** Eliminating unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
**Removing Duplicate Values:** Ensuring data integrity by deleting duplicates.
**Using Find and Replace:** Standardizing data entries by replacing inconsistent values.
**Changing Data Types:** Adjusting data types to match the requirements for analysis.
**Inserting New Conditional Columns:** Creating new columns based on conditions to enrich the dataset.
